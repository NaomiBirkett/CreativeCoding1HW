I was surprised to learn through the Learning Styles reading that learning styles have been somewhat disproven. I’ve always felt that there are distinct learning styles, and they do affect how we learn and succeed. I think my own life experiences with school and learning have influenced my beliefs about learning styles. After going through the readings, however, I think learning style is more about how we approach and use the material that is given to us, rather than how the material is presented.

Upon completing the learning styles quiz, I scored equally as a visual and tactile learner. This didn’t surprise me at all; I really succeeded in school early in life when school was all about creative hands-on projects, moving around and being active in the classroom, working in groups and learning through games, colored shapes in matching holes, etc. The more school became about focusing on lectures in class and slogging through huge blocks of text, I really started to struggle. I ultimately decided that I’d hit some kind of plateau in my learning ability and that school just wasn’t for me.

After returning to school later in life, I’ve found that completing school online has been successful for me. Taking classes online allows me to break up large lectures and readings into smaller parts by pausing and taking breaks periodically, lets me pause to write notes without getting distracted and missing the next part of the lecture, and even go back in a video and re-watch and listen to something I didn’t catch the first time. The asynchronous nature of my online classes also allows me to focus on school when I’m mentally and physically prepared to do so, while traditional schooling often meant having to attend class when I wasn’t feeling it. I think my learning styles play into all of this a lot, and the information from the styles quiz seems to confirm this.
