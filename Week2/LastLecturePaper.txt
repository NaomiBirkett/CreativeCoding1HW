The last lecture was really moving. I was very affected by Randy’s acceptance and positivity in the face of his own mortality. His outlook sort of seemed like, “I’ve lived a good life,” and he was using what time he had left to show others how they could do the same. He presents the lecture’s topic as being about following your dreams, but as he concludes in the end, it’s really about how trying to accomplish something can shape your life, even when you don’t necessarily achieve your dreams (or even, your dreams change as you move forward).

I really identified with his message about how not achieving all of his goals didn’t mean he had failed. As he grew up and learned more about the world and had experiences, his view of what achieving those goals changed over time. From turning down the permanent job offer as an imagineer, to meeting his boyhood idol William Shatner and realizing it was more exciting when they’re there to see you for your accomplishments than just meeting them because you’re excited about what they do, he demonstrated over and over throughout his lecture that it’s really about the journey and not so much the end result.
