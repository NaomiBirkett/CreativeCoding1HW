There are two different ways to interact with our computers: The GUI and the CLI. The GUI, or Graphical User Interface, is a modern way of interacting with a computer. This is the computer visuals that most computer users are used to seeing when they use a computer, such as the folders, icons, menus, scroll wheels, and buttons. Much of the GUI is set up in order to mimic a physical desk as a method to stay organized, with folders where we can place files and pictures, tool bars for the various tools we use within our computer, music or books housed within virtual programs rather than on a shelf, etc.
The other method of interacting with a computer is the CLI, or Command-Line Interface. The CLI is the most basic way of interacting with a computer, an older method that uses only text-based commands to tell the computer what you want to do. Interacting with a computer through CLI was much more common in the early days of computers when we didn’t have the technology to create the bright, colorful graphics and buttons of GUI that come standard with most modern computer systems these days. Using CLI can appear intimidating at first, but once you learn how to navigate a bit more, it’s really organized the same way as a GUI. CLI can actually be a faster way to navigate through directories, and can also be a more powerful way to interact with your computer.
